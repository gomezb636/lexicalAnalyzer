To test our code:
    1. Make sure to have the sample files to run the code against in the same directory as main.cpp.
    2. In your terminal, run the command "g++ main.cpp -o m"
    3. Next, run the command "./m"
    4. Then, the program will ask you for the file name. Type the file name. It can either be "program.cpp", "program.txt", or a file that you create on your own (as long as the file is inside the folder/directory).
    5. The program will then print the output into a txt file called "output.txt", which will be created when the program runs 
    *NOTE: it will not print the output into the terminal; it will print it into the output.txt file.
    
Our program is set to analyze any type of files.
